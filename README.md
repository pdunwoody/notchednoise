# Notched Noise Generator
A simple notched noise generator using python. This jupyter notebook noise generator can create and play white, pink, or brown white noise notched at specific frequencies and play them directly or create sound files for download and offline use. This type of noise has been explored by others for tinnitus relief.

The notebook can be run online using nbviewer (link to come) or downloaded and run locally.
